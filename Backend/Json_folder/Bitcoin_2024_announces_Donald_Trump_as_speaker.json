At a Mar-a-Lago event, he pledged to promote crypto if elected president. Trump’s campaign also began accepting cryptocurrency donations last month, garnering support from industry figures like the Gemini crypto exchange founders Winklevoss twins and Cathie Wood of Ark Invest.\nThe conference will feature other US political figures, including presidential candidate Robert F.
