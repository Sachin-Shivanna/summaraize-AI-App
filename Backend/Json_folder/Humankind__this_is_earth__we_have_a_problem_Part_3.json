Join us for smart, insightful posts and conversations about where the energy industry is and where it is going.\nPresentation\nI provide consulting services primarily assisting renewable energy-related companies in areas such as strategic planning, marketing, and operations. I have helped bring to market numerous leading...\nAccess Presentation\nYes, I’m going to spend the entire week reviewing the results of the Resources for the Future Climate Insights 2024 Report and with good reason.\nMany might read the report and think “this is good” the vast majority of people are thinking “green.” However, that isn’t what I see at all. In fact, the more I dig into the results the worse I believe they are.\nToday’s post illustrates what I mean.\nTomorrow, I’ll wrap up summarizing the results. And next week I’ll review what it means to the climate movement and what changes need to be made if we are to instill the kind of attitude among the general public that is necessary to achieve our net-zero goals.\nThe bottom line is that despite all the fabulous headlines on how much solar and wind is being installed, things in general aren’t going well. Yes, there are areas where significant improvements have been achieved, but not nearly enough, and the macro strategy is woefully flawed.\nThe first step in correcting course is to change the mindset of average people around the world. If successful, we can then begin to achieve meaningful changes in behavior and ramp the pressure on world leadership.\n#climatechange #globalwarming #climatechangeisreal #severeweather #climateaction\nNo discussions yet. Start a discussion below.\nEvery maturing industry eventually turns to automation to improve efficiencies and maintain profit margins. Solar is no different. Check out what one company is doing to expedite the construction of utility-scale solar projects.\nThe World Bank  Global Finance and Hydrogen Development\nOn this show, Dr. Katherine Johnson discusses the promise and pitfalls of solar ovens.\nMost people who follow the renewable energy industry know that California and Texas lead the way in solar deployment. But do you have any idea which state is the leader in rooftop systems on a per capita basis?\nThe Energy Central Power Industry Network® is based on one core idea - power industry professionals helping each other and advancing the industry by sharing and learning from each other.\nIf you have an experience or insight to share or have learned something from a conference or seminar, your peers and colleagues on Energy Central want to hear about it. It's also easy to share a link to an article you've liked or an industry resource that you think would be helpful.\nStart a Post »                  Learn more about posting on Energy Central »\nAnalyst - Senior Analyst, Utility Marketing and CX\n\t\t\tE Source\n\t\t\tDenver, Colorado\nChief Executive Officer \n\t\t\tCentral Valley Electric Cooperative \n\t\t\tArtesia, New Mexico\nVice President of Engineering\n\t\t\tLong Island Power Authority\n\t\t\tUniondale, New York\nChief Executive Officer\n\t\t\tKansas Electric Power Cooperative\n\t\t\tTopeka, Kansas\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\t\t\tNOVEC\n\t\t\tManassas, Virginia\nEngineering Associate II\n\t\t\tLower Colorado River Authority\n\t\t\tLa Grange, Texas\nExecutive Director\n\t\t\tRedwood Coast Energy Authority\n\t\t\tHumboldt County, California\nDirector, Division of Revenue & Rates\n\t\t\tNew Jersey Board of Public Utilities\n\t\t\tTrenton, New Jersey\nTransmission Line Engineer: Operations and Maintenance (Civil/Structural)\n\t\t\tLCRA\n\t\t\tAustin, Texas\nPower Management Control Engineer\n\t\t\tCity of Tallahassee\n\t\t\tTallahassee, Florida\nAssistant General Manager for the Electric & Gas Utility\n\t\t\tCity of Tallahassee\n\t\t\tTallahassee, Florida\nSenior Engineer - Grid Infrastructure\n\t\t\tNorth Carolina Electric Cooperatives\n\t\t\tRaleigh, North Carolina\nManager - Cybersecurity and Energy Management System\n\t\t\tBrazos Electric Cooperative\n\t\t\tWaco, Texas\nPower Plant Control Room Operator (Gas/Coal)\n\t\t\tLower Colorado River Authority (LCRA)\n\t\t\tLa Grange, Texas\nChief Executive Officer\n\t\t\tDuck River EMC\n\t\t\tShelbyville, Tennessee\n"
