    "content": "The internet has revolutionized the way people research and book travel. Travelers now have access to hotel- and flight-booking platforms, travel content on social media, travel blogs, and travel publications.\nToday's travelers, especially those seeking luxury experiences, don't always want to wade through all that information. Consequently, the travel-advisor industry has experienced significant growth in recent years, especially among Gen Z and millennial travelers. According to Grand View Research, the global luxury-travel market is worth an estimated $1.3 trillion and expected to grow 7.9% from 2024 to 2030.\nLuxury travelers are not necessarily looking for the best deals but the best way to plan a trip without the hassle. This is where a luxury-travel advisor comes in. Agents can provide personalized itineraries, access to upgrades and selective experiences, and support throughout the trip.\nBusiness Insider talked to three luxury-travel advisors about the industry's growth and how to transition into travel advising.\nDiana Hechler, the owner of D. Tours Travel, said the luxury-travel industry has grown because travelers have access to more luxury-level properties, and more people are willing to pay luxury prices. Also, a vacation is seen as a necessity for Gen Z travelers.\n\"People are booking vacations more than ever and want them to be stress-free and restorative. And nothing does that better than luxury travel,\" Hechler told BI. \"Despite the higher prices, the segment of travelers that want luxury and are willing to pay for it has grown as well.\"\nAngela Adto Tepper, the owner of AZA Luxury Travel, said that the shift toward luxury travel had increased since the pandemic, with more Americans prioritizing travel.\n\"The luxury-travel sector has evolved to prioritize wellness, health, sustainability, and transformative experiences, and people are now prioritizing meaningful travel experiences and pursuing bucket-list trips,\" Tepper said. \"Advisors have adapted by curating journeys tailored to each client.\"\nOne of the biggest advantages of working with a travel advisor is that it helps travelers cut through the noise and information overload. Traveler agents work on commission, getting a percentage of hotel, cruise, or tour costs, which is paid after a trip is over. Many agents also charge an up-front fee for research and planning.\n\"The internet was supposed to be the death of advisors, and instead, it's made us more valuable than ever,\" Hechler said. \"While some people love to spend time researching their vacations and doing it themselves, many don't have time to 'waste' on the internet starting from scratch. Saving time is problem-solving for almost everyone; anytime you can solve people's problems, you can have a successful business.\"\nTravel advisors can also offer complimentary upgrades and have access to experiences that might not be available to the public.\n\"Working with a travel advisor can be summarized by three E's,\" Tepper said. \"We can provide expertise and insider knowledge, extras with personalized service, and emergency assistance.\"\nWith the prevalence of Instagram and TikTok, it might seem like everyone is going to the same places. So booking luxury hotels or making reservations at Michelin-starred restaurants is no longer enough; travelers want advisors to curate one-of-a-kind experiences.\n\"The luxury-travel sector is not just about opulence and indulgence but also about creating meaningful, enriching experiences that leave a lasting impact,\" Maurice Smith, the founder and CEO of the luxury-travel agency Eugene Toriko, said. \"Sustainable and regenerative travel practices are becoming increasingly important, focusing on preserving and enhancing the destinations we visit.\"\nIf you're ready to move into the industry, it's worth taking stock of your skills first. For example, Tepper said people with event-planning experience might transition well into travel advising since itinerary planning and familiarity with booking platforms are part of the job. She added that soft skills, like interpersonal communication, problem-solving, and adaptability, would also come in handy.\nTepper recommended contacting an advisor before switching over. \"If you're considering the career change, one of the best things you can do is secure a reputable mentor,\" she said. \"A mentor can offer invaluable guidance, accelerating professional growth and enhancing skill development, leading to greater success and higher earnings.\"\nIt also helps to study travel trends, have a deep knowledge of a destination, and build expertise around types of travel, such as multigenerational trips, cruises, or honeymoons. Tepper said that prospective advisors must also remember that they're not necessarily looking for the \"best discounts\" for clients but creating tailored trips with impeccable customer service.\n\"To maintain the quality of our personalized work, we occasionally have to turn away a client,\" Tepper said. \"Not every client is the right fit for our service. This selectivity ensures that we can devote the necessary time and attention to crafting great experiences for everyone while upholding the high standards we have put in place.\"\nTravel advising provides valuable services to travelers, but agents can also receive perks like complimentary trips sponsored by hotels and tourism boards and travel discounts.\n\"One of the biggest perks of this job is the opportunity to explore the world and indulge in my passion for travel,\" Tepper said. \"Imagine waking up in a new city, tasting exotic cuisines, and immersing yourself in diverse cultures while doing what you love. For me, it's a career that blends passion and purpose.\"\nThe job also comes with a few challenges. Smith said that agents must stay on top of ever-changing travel regulations to ensure the safety of their clients. But ultimately, he said, it's a rewarding career that prioritizes relationships.\n\"Travel advising offers flexibility and the potential to work remotely, allowing for a good work-life balance,\" Smith said. \"Additionally, the satisfaction of helping clients create unforgettable memories and the joy of turning their travel dreams into reality is incredibly rewarding.\"\nJump to"
