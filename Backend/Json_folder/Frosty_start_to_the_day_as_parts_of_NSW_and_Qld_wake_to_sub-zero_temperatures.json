The cold snap will continue tomorrow, with the chance some records will be broken. Getting out of bed is just that bit tougher across parts of New South Wales and Queensland this morning, where residents are waking up to sub-zero temperatures.  At 6:30am the coldest part of NSW was the Goulburn Airport in the Southern Tablelands, where the temperature reached -5.7 degrees Celsius.  On the south-west slopes, the temperature at Young was -4.7C, while further west at Temora it was -4.8C.  Temora's record low is -6.4C.  It was a similar story north of the border, where the Wellcamp Airport at Toowoomba recorded a low of -5.7C at 6:28am.  Other cold spots in the Darling Downs-Granite Belt area included Oakey (-5.4C), Warwick (-4.5C) and Dalby (-4.4C).  Soldiers were also feeling the chill with the army barracks at Kapooka, on the outskirts of Wagga Wagga, recording a temperature of -4.4C.
