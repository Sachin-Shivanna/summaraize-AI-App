Join us for smart, insightful posts and conversations about where the energy industry is and where it is going.\nPresentation\nI provide consulting services primarily assisting renewable energy-related companies in areas such as strategic planning, marketing, and operations. I have helped bring to market numerous leading...\nAccess Presentation\nThe Climate Message Needs to Change (Part 3): A Generational Approach\nThis is the final post (for now) on the subject of crafting a more effective message on climate change.\nThis three-part messaging recommendation series was prompted by two surveys (PEW Research and the Climate Insights 2024 Report) on attitudes toward energy and climate change. The results of both surveys indicate that the climate change message has been ineffective.\nIt should be noted that both surveys were U.S.-based. However, it’s reasonable to assume similar attitudes exist in other developed countries. If anyone has information to the contrary, please share it. I have no desire to perpetuate untruths.\nYesterday I offered recommendations six through 10.  Today, because there is no single message that will resonate with everyone, we take a generational approach. Every generation holds different attitudes. The climate movement needs to develop a unique message for each generation, and that message needs to have a specific purpose and goal.\nAgain, these thoughts are a work in process. I don’t pretend to have all the answers, and I welcome a dialogue.\n#climatechange #globalwarming #climatechangeisreal #severeweather #climateaction #emissions #carbonemissions #climatescience\nNo discussions yet. Start a discussion below.\nEvery maturing industry eventually turns to automation to improve efficiencies and maintain profit margins. Solar is no different. Check out what one company is doing to expedite the construction of utility-scale solar projects.\nOn this show, Dr. Katherine Johnson discusses the promise and pitfalls of solar ovens.\nMost people who follow the renewable energy industry know that California and Texas lead the way in solar deployment. But do you have any idea which state is the leader in rooftop systems on a per capita basis?\nRecently United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability completed its three-year investigation into how U.S. oil companies sought to avoid accountability for climate change.\nThe Energy Central Power Industry Network® is based on one core idea - power industry professionals helping each other and advancing the industry by sharing and learning from each other.\nIf you have an experience or insight to share or have learned something from a conference or seminar, your peers and colleagues on Energy Central want to hear about it.
