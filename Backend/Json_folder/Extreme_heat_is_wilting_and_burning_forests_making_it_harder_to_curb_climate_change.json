Temperatures in 2023 were so high — and the droughts and wildfires that came with them were so severe — that forests in various parts of the world wilted and burned enough to have degraded the ability of the land to lock away carbon dioxide and act as a check on global warming, the study said. The scientists behind the research, which focuses on 2023, caution that their findings are preliminary. But the work represents a disturbing data point — one that, if it turns into a trend, spells trouble for the planet and the people on it. “We have to be, of course, careful because it’s just one year,” said Philippe Ciais, a scientist at France’s Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences who co-authored the new research. But the results, he added, are still “worrying.” If extreme warming continues, society risks losing “the best friend of humanity” in Earth’s land. Earth’s continents act as what is known as a carbon sink. The carbon dioxide that humans emit through activities such as burning fossil fuels and making cement encourages the growth of plants, which in turn absorb a portion of those greenhouse gases and lock them in wood and soil. Without this help from forests, climate change would be worse than what is already occurring.\n(Excerpt) Read more at msn.com ...\n\nTOPICS: Constitution/Conservatism; Culture/Society; News/Current Events; Politics/Elections\nKEYWORDS: chat; climatechange; climatechangehoax; fakenews; globalwarming; globalwarminghoax; hoax; propaganda; socialism; washingtoncompost\n\n\nNavigation: use the links below to view more comments.\nfirst 1-20, 21-40, 41-51 next last\n\n\n\n\n1\nposted on 07/26/2024 11:17:30 AM PDT\nby Oldeconomybuyer\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: Oldeconomybuyer\n\nNot a word about pollution from India and China.\n\n2\nposted on 07/26/2024 11:18:11 AM PDT\nby Steely Tom\n([Voter Fraud] == [Civil War])\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 1\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: Oldeconomybuyer\n\nIt’s imperative that cow farts are stopped now!\n\n3\nposted on 07/26/2024 11:18:42 AM PDT\nby ABStrauss\n(I miss Rlush!)\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 1\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: Oldeconomybuyer\n\nThe mass media thinks if they yell “climate change” a billion times the unwashed masses will buy it.\nThis is total overkill.\n\n4\nposted on 07/26/2024 11:19:13 AM PDT\nby cgbg\n(\"Our democracy\" = Their Kleptocracy)\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 1\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: Oldeconomybuyer\n\nhttps://abc7.com/post/car-salvage-yard-burning-lancaster-sending-thick-black/15096339/\n\n5\nposted on 07/26/2024 11:19:18 AM PDT\nby rfp1234\n(E Porcibus Unum)\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 1\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: rfp1234\n\nAll the ‘green’ virtue signaling activities go up in flames.
