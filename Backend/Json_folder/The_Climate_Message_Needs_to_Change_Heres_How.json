Join us for smart, insightful posts and conversations about where the energy industry is and where it is going.\nPresentation\nI provide consulting services primarily assisting renewable energy-related companies in areas such as strategic planning, marketing, and operations. I have helped bring to market numerous leading...\nAccess Presentation\nI’ve spent almost two weeks reviewing recent surveys on attitudes toward energy and climate change. During that time I’ve lambasted the climate movement for its poorly thought out messaging strategy.\nNot to be thought of as someone who simply acts as a critic, today it’s time to offer an alternative strategy. Here are five recommendations to create a more effective climate change communication strategy.\nTomorrow I’ll offer up recommendations six through 10.\nI welcome alternative opinions. Let’s start a dialogue.\n#climatechange #globalwarming #climatechangeisreal #severeweather #climateaction #emissions #carbonemissions #climatescience\n\nTony- I think these are great strategies, and I look forward to 6-10. Sometimes, I think of the climate situation a little more like a byproduct of our relatively immature energy system. We're still only separated by a handful of generations from when electric transmission was even developed! We've taken societal shortcuts to handle the rapid deployment of electrical usage, and one of the downsides of those shortcuts is that we've rapidly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. We've also pumped vast amounts of other extremely harmful substances into the atmosphere, which have had enormous and almost incalculable health effects on the global population.\nSo- while we do indeed have a climate situation on our hands, it is going to be hard to get society on board with trying to come up with the best solution when we take the divisive approach. We need to take a holistic approach to solving the energy situation, not just the climate situation.\nTom - couldn't agree more. I have made the same \"holistic approach\" point a number of times. And hopefully, in the not too distant future we can take politics out of the equation - at least to some extent - and make it about the facts.\nSeems to me the objective should be to focus on reasonably priced energy. The nature of green energy will lead to lower CO2 emissions levels. Aim for what is achievable, as opposed to the unrealistic.\nFor the most part that is what is occurring. Despite their inherent drawbacks solar and wind are proliferating because they have reached price parity with oil and gas - sort of. In terms of other technologies, getting price points down requires research, investments, and time. Not too mention economies of scale - which is a bit of a chicken-egg dilemma. Bottom line - we don't know which technologies will yield the best price performance until we flesh them out.\nHydrogen-Electric propulsion for Large Aircraft\nEvery maturing industry eventually turns to automation to improve efficiencies and maintain profit margins. Solar is no different. Check out what one company is doing to expedite the construction of utility-scale solar projects.\nOn this show, Dr. Katherine Johnson discusses the promise and pitfalls of solar ovens.\nMost people who follow the renewable energy industry know that California and Texas lead the way in solar deployment. But do you have any idea which state is the leader in rooftop systems on a per capita basis?\nThe Energy Central Power Industry Network® is based on one core idea - power industry professionals helping each other and advancing the industry by sharing and learning from each other.\nIf you have an experience or insight to share or have learned something from a conference or seminar, your peers and colleagues on Energy Central want to hear about it. It's also easy to share a link to an article you've liked or an industry resource that you think would be helpful.\nStart a Post »                  Learn more about posting on Energy Central »\nAnalyst - Senior Analyst, Utility Marketing and CX\n\t\t\tE Source\n\t\t\tDenver, Colorado\nChief Executive Officer \n\t\t\tCentral Valley Electric Cooperative \n\t\t\tArtesia, New Mexico\nVice President of Engineering\n\t\t\tLong Island Power Authority\n\t\t\tUniondale, New York\nChief Executive Officer\n\t\t\tKansas Electric Power Cooperative\n\t\t\tTopeka, Kansas\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\t\t\tNOVEC\n\t\t\tManassas, Virginia\nEngineering Associate II\n\t\t\tLower Colorado River Authority\n\t\t\tLa Grange, Texas\nExecutive Director\n\t\t\tRedwood Coast Energy Authority\n\t\t\tHumboldt County, California\nDirector, Division of Revenue & Rates\n\t\t\tNew Jersey Board of Public Utilities\n\t\t\tTrenton, New Jersey\nTransmission Line Engineer: Operations and Maintenance (Civil/Structural)\n\t\t\tLCRA\n\t\t\tAustin, Texas\nPower Management Control Engineer\n\t\t\tCity of Tallahassee\n\t\t\tTallahassee, Florida\nAssistant General Manager for the Electric & Gas Utility\n\t\t\tCity of Tallahassee\n\t\t\tTallahassee, Florida\nSenior Engineer - Grid Infrastructure\n\t\t\tNorth Carolina Electric Cooperatives\n\t\t\tRaleigh, North Carolina\nManager - Cybersecurity and Energy Management System\n\t\t\tBrazos Electric Cooperative\n\t\t\tWaco, Texas\nPower Plant Control Room Operator (Gas/Coal)\n\t\t\tLower Colorado River Authority (LCRA)\n\t\t\tLa Grange, Texas\nChief Executive Officer\n\t\t\tDuck River EMC\n\t\t\tShelbyville, Tennessee\n"
