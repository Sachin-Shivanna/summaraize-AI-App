Through bioengineering and cognitive modeling, it mimics cellular functions to develop advanced computational neuroscience.\nIntroduction\nOrganoid intelligence (OI) is a new but exciting and at the same time fascinating field that combines the oceans of computer science and biology. OI is an emerging field of artificial intelligence (AI) that approximates human intelligence through computer programs and algorithms that rely on intricate mathematical models and data processing on silicon-based computers. The goal of OI is to grow functional, miniature brains in a lab and interface them with computers. Essentially, OI is a branch of study that enables us to use 3D cultures of human brain cells, commonly referred to as brain organoids, to study and research biological computing.\nFollowing that, these artificial organoids would be interacted with using the brain-machine interface technology. The notion of \"biological hardware\" can be tailored to these organoids, which have a plethora of undiscovered opportunities and possibilities for artificial intelligence with faster, more efficient, and more computational capacity. Brain organoids are being studied for their potential to advance understanding because they can essentially mimic the structure and functions of the human brain.\nA potential advantage of organoid intelligence is that it might be more energy-efficient than typical AI due to its greater learning and storage capabilities. The relationship between a stem cell donor and the corresponding organoid system, as well as the potential for organoids to gain consciousness and sentience, constitute a few of the ethical concerns that surround this technology.\nResearchers researching organoid intelligence (OI) are additionally investigating whether biological computing and OI can supplement conventional silicon-based computing, although there are ethical concerns with this strategy. Such ethical dilemmas include, for instance, the question of the relationship between an organoid's growing stem cell donor and the corresponding organoid system, in addition to OIs developing consciousness and sentience as organoids.\nWhile these structures are still far from having strong computing capabilities or the ability to think like the typical human brain, it's nevertheless significant to keep in mind that research on OI has the potential to expand our knowledge of brain development, learning, and memory as well as lead to the discovery of potential treatments for neurological conditions.\nConsidering all facts, the potential for organoid intelligence to revolutionize computing and our understanding of the brain is huge. However, it is still in its initial stages of development and before it reaches its full potential, there are still many significant challenges that must be conquered before we can fully explore the enchanting universe of organoids!\nOrganoid intelligence (OI) is a new but exciting and at the same time fascinating field that combines the oceans of computer science and biology.
