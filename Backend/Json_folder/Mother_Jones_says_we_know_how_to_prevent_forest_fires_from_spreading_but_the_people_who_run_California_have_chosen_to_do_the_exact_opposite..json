Bunch of do-gooders.\nI’m surprised Mother Jones is saying this (or that ‘she’ is even still around) because Mother Jones is the most liberal of all ‘mothers’.\nLeftism:  Evil is Good  Bitter is Sweet  Down is Up\nLeftism:  Evil is Good  Bitter is Sweet  Down is Up\nEvil is Good  Bitter is Sweet  Down is Up\nBitter is Sweet  Down is Up\nDown is Up\n“Further complicating the picture is climate change—the major factor behind the longer fire seasons and bigger fires.\nOne study projected that if fossil fuels remain the dominant source of global energy and greenhouse gas emissions keep rising, by 2085 the acreage burned by fire in California will increase one-third to three-fourths.”\nHad to get that in there.\nThe treehuggers out thisaway made that deal ages ago — let us dictate “management” of forests and we will deliver voting block or fires on demand — to encourage more tax $$.\nPG&E had an opportunity to rat this scam out when they got (wrongly) accused of fires caused by their power lines. Yeah, they fraudulently mis-appropriated $$ from rate increases that was mandated for management of forests beneath their lines. But, BUT, it is CaCaLand gov’mt that chooses to not clear out undergrowth across hundreds of square miles. It is that undergrowth that is the source of all widespread wildfires.\nPG&E could have gone to court and forced the corrupt gov’mt to describe their management. But, they made more $$$ by agreeing to hide it.\nBTWay, I worked for PG&E for ~ten years. This is not hyperbole. They are as corrupt as the gov’mt.\nPDJT said to rake the trees out and the evil commies couldn’t get the video out fast enough of people with tiny rakes raking bark on trees…\nLet’s not forget the wacko enviro-terrorists that go out and start forest fires to prove global warming is real now.\nThis in Wyoming near Yellowstone. I guess when the will is there the brush can be cleared.\n“Let’s not forget the wacko enviro-terrorists that go out and start forest fires to prove global warming is real now.”\nI know I will never forget them!
