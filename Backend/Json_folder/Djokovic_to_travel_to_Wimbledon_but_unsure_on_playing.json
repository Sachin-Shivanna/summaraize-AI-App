A lot of it comes down to the inflammation and how you react,â he told reporters.\n\"When I did it, I couldn't even walk. People are different. You pretty much have your full strength immediately.\n\"It's more just the inflammation from the surgery. As long as you can get that down and start playing without it puffing up again, you're going to be fine to play.\"\nBeing able to win seven five-set matches in a fortnight may be beyond even Djokovic, but a rapid recovery means he will at least be in London to see whether a 19th appearance at the championships is realistic.\nThe tennis competition at the Paris Olympics begins on 27 July, just 13 days after Wimbledon finishes.\nLive scores, results and order of play\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone\nRose has 'chance to live out Open dream' at Royal Troon\nEngland have to 'kick on', says Woakes\nSix races and rivalries to watch in Paris Olympic pool\nWhat went wrong?\nIn 2023, a triple-train crash in India killed nearly 300 people and injured more than 800\nHow should we remember the âPeopleâs Princessâ today?\nPrincess Diana was a role model for millions however, her life was far from the fairytale\nDetective fiction, fantasy epics and spy novels\nAndrew Marr deconstructs their conventions to show how these books keep us turning the page\nExploring the science behind our favourite board games\nFrom the global history of games to how key games are to developing a theory of mind\nHodgkinson sets national record with 800m win.
